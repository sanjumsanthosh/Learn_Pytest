# Chapter 7 - Stratergy

##### This chapter starts by defining goals for test suite, how architecure of Cards has influence on the stratergy, selecting and prioritizing functions, generate list of test cases & thus generate a pretty decent initial test suite.

## Tests

### Determining Test Scope

* Test scope can be determined by asing a series of questions like is security a concern?, should we focus on performance ? , Would loading time become a problem ? or do we need input validation ?

### Considering softwre architecture

* Testing stratergy fully depends on software archetecture. like which level to test, and how each modules are implemented

### Evauating the  features to test

* its generatlly good to prioritze the functions for testings. Recent > core > Risk  Problematic > Expertise

### Creatign Test Cases

* Start with a happy path is better because
  * makes thinking abt the other criteria pretty easy
  * we must hurry and test the happy path

### Writing a Test Stratergy

Event with a quick summary , its easy to forget the detaisl once we are in the thick of testing. So its best to write a testing strartergy down so to reffer later
