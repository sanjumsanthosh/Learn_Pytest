### What is CI

* Earlier there was integration, which is like a group merge when muliple code changes were available
* CI is a tool which build an drun tests all on their own, ususally triggered by an MR
* This frequency makes it so that the code changes is smaller and reduces the chance of Merge conflicts
* CI tools have the ability to merge automaticaly but usually merging is done manually after code reviews
